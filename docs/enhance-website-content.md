What is a compounded GLP-1?
Compounded weight loss medications are specially formulated treatments that often belong to classes of medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, GIP receptor agonists, or similar compounds. These medications mimic naturally occurring hormones in the body, such as GLP-1 and GIP, which are released in response to food intake.

One of the primary functions of these hormones is to stimulate insulin production and lower blood sugar levels, making them valuable in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. However, when used in higher amounts, these compounds also interact with brain receptors that control appetite and satiety, leading to reduced hunger and increased feelings of fullness.

When prescribed by a medical provider in conjunction with a healthy diet and regular exercise, compounded weight loss medications can contribute to weight reduction. This weight loss is often accompanied by additional health benefits, including a lower risk of chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, particularly in individuals who are obese or overweight.

What if side effects occur?
At Enhance.MD, you will undergo multiple consultations with a medical provider at crucial junctures to identify the safest and most effective medication for you. Throughout these consultations, your provider will closely monitor your response to the medication to ensure that it is effectively addressing your needs. Many side effects can be easily managed and only in rare instances does treatment need to be stopped.

How do I know if I am eligible?
During your video consultation with your Enhance.MD provider will thoroughly review all medical information and determine your eligibility for a personalized weight loss treatment plan.

What is a compounded GLP-1 + GIP?
This medication belongs to a class of treatments known as dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. It works by mimicking the actions of both the GIP and GLP-1 hormones, which are naturally released in response to eating.

GIP and GLP-1 play key roles in regulating blood sugar levels by stimulating insulin production and lowering glucose levels. Because of these effects, this treatment has been used to manage Type 2 diabetes.

Beyond its impact on blood sugar, it also influences brain regions responsible for appetite control, helping to reduce hunger and promote a greater sense of fullness. When combined with diet and exercise, it can lead to significant weight loss and may lower the risk of conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers in individuals who are overweight or obese.

What if side effects occur?
At Enhance.MD, you will undergo multiple consultations with a medical provider at crucial junctures to identify the safest and most effective medication for you. Throughout these consultations, your provider will closely monitor your response to the medication to ensure that it is effectively addressing your needs. Many side effects can be easily managed and only in rare instances does treatment need to be stopped.
